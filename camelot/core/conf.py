"""
The global configuration of a Camelot application is handled through a LazyProxy
object that reads settings from various targets.  The default target reads
the attributes from the 'settings' module, if this is found on the PYTHONPATH.

To access the global configuration, simply import the settings object::
    
    from camelot.core.conf import settings
    
    print settings.CAMELOT_MEDIA_ROOT
    
Developers can add targets to the settings proxy, to enable reading settings
from other sources.
