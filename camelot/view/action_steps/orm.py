"""
Various ``ActionStep`` subclasses that inform the GUI of changes
in the model.

These action steps can be used to update the GUI before changes have been
saved to the database through the manual updates :
    
.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/test_action.py
   :start-after: begin manual update
   :end-before: end manual update
       
Or use introspection of the SQLAlchemy session to update the GUI :

.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/test_action.py
   :start-after: begin auto update
   :end-before: end auto update
