"""Camelot includes editors for various types of fields.  Each editor at least supports
these features :


 * a set_value method to set a python type as the editor's value

 * a get_value method to retrieve a python type from the editor

 * the ValueLoading state : an editor has as its value ValueLoading upon construction and
the editor's value can be set to ValueLoading if the value that should be displayed is
not yet available in the GUI thread, but is still on it's way from the model to the GUI.
This means that once set_value( ValueLoading ) is called, get_value() will always return
ValueLoading until set_value is called with another argument.
